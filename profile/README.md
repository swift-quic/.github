## Hi there 👋
You've reached the SwiftQuic organization's profile on GitHub.

Our goal is to provide open-source [Swift](https://www.swift.org/about/) implementations of [QUIC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9000) and [HTTP/3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9114). Repositories first created on personal profiles were transferred here to emphasize our open and collaborative
aspect. Any contribution, ideas, criticism, or code, is welcome and greatly appreciated.

Checkout our projects:

- [SwiftQuic](https://github.com/swift-quic/swift-quic): core QUIC library. 
- ...: more to come.
